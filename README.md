CannaMed

## Description

CannaMed is a website where users of medical cannabis will be able to come and find out more about the strains that are available. Some of the information included is ailments that strains usually treat as well as what feelings it generally produces. 

Cannabis affects people differently so, under the supervision of your doctor, it is recommended that you experiment with different strains to find the ones that are best suited to your particular circumstance. Since there are so many different strains, this website will be a great resource to do some research and save your favorites. With this information you and your doctor will be able to more efficiently adjust your medication plan.
