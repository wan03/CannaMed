            </h4>

            <p style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Cannabutter is the essential ingredient for any weed bake. Don’t be intimidated, it is extremely easy to make.

              Here’s what you need to make basic cannabutter.
              
              Ingredients:
              
              A cup or less of water
              1 lb. of butter, unsalted
              1 oz. of high quality lightly ground weed bud or trim
              The basic process is to put your decarboxylated weed and butter in a pot with a little water just to make sure the butter doesn’t burn, and heat on a low simmer for 3 to 6 hours. Long as the butter doesn’t burn, the longer you heat, the more cannabinoids you get in the butter. Some prefer to heat in a crockpot to 6 hours. Let it cool enough to handle, strain out the plant material and discard (the thc is now inside the butter!), then put it in the fridge overnight for it to harden. Next, remove the hardened butter from the residual water and you have your main ingredient, your precious canna butter infused with powerful cannabinoids</p>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Making weed cookies is a good way to share with friends and easily monitor your dosage. Say you have used an ounce of weed in your canna butter, that is 28 grams of weed infused into the canna oil. A bowl smoked is 0.3 to 1 gram. So, if you make 28 cookies, each cookie is a large bowl smoked. If you have used a very potent strain, make 56 small cookies or advise your guests to break the cookies in half and have just a small piece every two hours. You can easily monitor your dose by having just one cookie or half of a cookie every two hours.

              Making the cookies is simple. Just use the recipe on a store-bought cookie mix and use your weed butter where the recipe calls for butter or oil.
              
              If you are making cookies from scratch, you will need these ingredients:
              
              Chocolate chips, two cups
              All-purpose flower, two cups
              Sugar, half a cup
              Brown sugar, half a cup
              Baking soda, teaspoon
              Salt, teaspoon
              Vanilla extract, teaspoon
              2 eggs
              1 cup of canna butter
              Water
              
              Preheat your oven to 370 degrees. Put your canna butter in a large mixing bowl and mix in your vanilla extract and sugar. Use another bowl and mix your flour, salt, and baking soda. Stir in your eggs, brown sugar, chips, and all other ingredients, mixing in just enough water to make a hard semi-solid. Now stir in your canna butter and size your cookies by how much weed you used. If you used a half ounce, make at least 14 cookies. Each cookie will be equal to one large bowl of smoked marijuana. Remember effects take at least an hour, so don’t eat too many cookies but enjoy just one cookie or a half and you will get amazing results</p>
